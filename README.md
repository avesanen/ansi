# ANSI Window Management System

ANSI gfx kit for my future multiplayer roguelike endeavours.

VT100

## Planned functionality:

- Make it easy to create views that have their own handlers for drawing and input.
- Views should also be able to handle views withing themselves.
- Change focus between different views, redirecting input to that view.
- Change between line-by-line input and keycode by keycode input.
- Choose area where getline is visible.
- Scroll/wrap the getline area
- Simple api to frontend, bytes in, bytes out.

## Planned examples:

- SSH server
- Telnet server
- Websocket + hterm.js
